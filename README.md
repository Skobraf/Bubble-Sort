# Bubble Sort
## Implementation of the algorithm Bubble Sort

Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order.

Bubble sort has a worst-case and average complexity of Ðž(n2), where n is the number of items being sorted. Most practical sorting algorithms have substantially better worst-case or average complexity, often O(n log n).
